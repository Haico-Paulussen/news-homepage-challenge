## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### Continued development

So right now I learned basic HTML, CSS, Flexbox and CSS Grid. Next step for me is to start learning basic JavaScript so I can work on my long term goal: Learn VUE.js (and/or other frameworks).
